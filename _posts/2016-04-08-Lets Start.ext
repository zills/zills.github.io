Hi Guys,

I have no idea what to start with. Let me tell something about myself. I am an IT bachelor and And working with multiple  firms from past couple of years. I started as a Unix administrator, gradually paving my way towards becoming an system architect. In between I got a chance to implement and work on technologies like Pivotal Hadoop, Informatica Power Center, Master Data Management, Green Plump and so on. I am really fascinated and excited about  how this systems process and manipulate huge amount of data.
